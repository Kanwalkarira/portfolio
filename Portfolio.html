    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Kanwal Karira</strong>, a <strong>21-year-old web developer</strong> and student from <strong>Shikarpur</strong>, in the province of <strong>Sindh, Pakistan</strong>.</p>
      <p>I completed my basic education at High Tech Public School Shikarpur, then matriculated from Ahmed Children Paradise Higher Secondary School Shikarpur. Afterward, I did my intermediate studies at C&S Government Degree College Shikarpur. Currently, I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Sukkur IBA University.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I have an intense interest in technology and am always learning new things about computer science. I can develop websites that are both visually appealing and responsive because I have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS. My knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles has also been enhanced by my expertise with Java and C++.</p>
      <p>As I pursue my education, I'm learning more about data analysis and developing my capacity to decipher and draw conclusions from data. Despite the fact that I've honed my talents in these areas, I'm constantly keen to learn new things and keep up with technological changes.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I’ve worked on a few projects that have significantly enhanced my skills. One of the notable projects I completed is a <strong>Blood Management System</strong> using Java and OOP principles. This system helps manage blood donations, donor details, and blood availability in hospitals, allowing for efficient tracking and record-keeping. It reinforced my understanding of OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while solving a real-world problem.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I created a <strong>Thrift Fashion Website</strong> for clothes, shoes, and accessories. This project allowed me to focus on designing user-friendly interfaces, building an online shopping platform that showcases products effectively. Lastly, I built my own <strong>Portfolio Website</strong> using HTML and CSS, where I showcased my work and skills. This project helped me improve my front-end design capabilities and develop a polished, professional web presence.</p>
